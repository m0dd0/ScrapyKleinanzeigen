### article attributes
- name                  the name of the article
- price                 the price of the article, if "zu verschenken" price is set to 0, sometimes no price is given (even if it seems to be impossible to create an article without price, price is only "VB" or nothing at all) in this case price is set to none
- negotiable            if the proce was marked with 
- postal_code           the postal code of the article
- timestamp             the time of creation of this article in seconds after 1970 (however only minutely accuracy provided)
- description           the intro of the description of the article 
- dispatchable          if there is the "Versand möglich" tag in the tags
- offer                 if its an offer or an search (detemined by the existance of the "gesuch" tag)
- tags                  a list of tags other than "gesuch" or "Versand möglich"
- category              the main category this article belongs to (can be found out only by using the corresponding serach url)
- sub_category          the sub category this article belongs to (can be found out only by using the corresponding serach url)
- commercial_offer      if this article is offered by an shop etc (can be found out only by using the corresponding serach url)
- pro_shop_link         some commercial articles provide an link to their shop (together with a "pro" tag), none in the most cases
- top_article           if the article is marked with the top flag
- highlight_article     if the article is marked as highlighted
- image                 the thumbnail of the article

To get all the needed categories we need to search by (sub)category and commercial/private offer.

One spider is responsible for scraping the articles of one category.
Each spider iterates over the pages [1:50] until multiple duplicates are found.
Scheduling the spiders every minute should be enough to catch every article even in 
the most popular categories.
To avoid intensive lookup for each article if its already saved, the articles of 
each crawling session getting saved seperately so we only need to query them.

We should also save some metadata for the crawling session itself like:
- category and commercial/private
- what time
- how many new articles fetched / how many pages visited
With this information we can later adapt the intervals of the crawlers to minimize
traffic or to ensure that all articles got scraped.

A scraper which checks for new categories and updates the json should be run every
day etc.

## Approximation of needed scraping interval
Each article page contains 25(+2) articles. 
We set the interval for crawling to DOWNLOAD_DELAY
If we directly restart the crawler after it has finished we can scrape at maximum
25/DOWNLOAD_DELAY articles per second.
If we want to catch all articles which get uploaded we need to adjust the DOWNLOAD_DELAY
depending on the uploaded article per second:
n_ups: uploaded articles per second
n_page: articles displayed on a single page (=25)
t_delay: DOWNLOAD_DELAY setting

t_delay = n_page/n_ups
n_ups = n_page/t_delay

n_ups [n_upm, n_uph]        t_delay
10 [600, 36.000]            25/10 = 2.5
40 [2.400, 144.000]         25/40 = 0.625
100 [6000, 360.000]         25/100 = 0.25 

Auto-Haupt-KAtegorie hat ca 5.000.000 Artikel, was ca 10% der Gesamtmenge an Artikeln
darstellt. In dieser KAtegorie wurden am 25.12. zwischen 14.13-14.14 Uhr ca 250 Artikel
hochgeladen (=4 Artikel pro Sekunde). Wenn man dies auf alle Kategorien extrapoliert
erhält man ca 40 Artike pro Sekunde was einem maximalen DOWNLOAD_DELAY von 0.625s 
entspricht.
Man muss allerigs anmerken dass diese Zahl aufgrund von nicht representativer KAtegorie,
Datum und Tageszeit strak abweichen kann.

## idead
Scrape more filtered metadata on article count in different regions/citys depending on category.

## ban protection
visitting website with browser manually: 141pages/1.33 min --> <1s Download Delay
but even if using a DOWNLOAD_DELAY of 3s > 1s scraper gets blocked
If scraper blocked website can still be accessed via browser BUT only if cookies are enabled in browser
--> Detection is done via cookies somehow
running scraper with cookies enabled and DOWNLOAD_DELAY=3 and "normal" USER_AGENT still results in blocking
--> Trying rotating proxies
